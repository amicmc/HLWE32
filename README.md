# HLWE32

Due to bad supported new boards offered by Heltec I've __frankesteinized__ these two repos for my own use:

- https://github.com/eiannone/Heltec_Esp32_LoRaWan
- https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/tree/master/esp32/libraries/LoraWan102

Feel free to do with this whatever you want or can.
